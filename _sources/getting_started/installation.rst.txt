Installation
==========================

This solver is developed based on FENICS, which is run on Linux-based platform. 

Installing WSL for Windows user
---------------------------------
This section is for Windows user only. For linux or Mas OS user, please skip this section.

For Windows users, the `WSL`_ (Windows Subsystem for Linux) may be needed. 

To install WSL, open PowerShell or Windows Command Prompt in administrator mode by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator", enter the wsl --install command, then restart your machine. 

.. code:: PowerShell

  wsl --install

For more details of WSL's intallations, please refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

After the WSL is installed, open a linux terminal shell by going to 'start' and running 'Ubuntu', from which a unix account name and password should be set first (The password can be empty).

Then please follow below sections to install FENICS

.. _`WSL` : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

Install conda
---------------------------------
We recommand using conda to install fenics.

Check conda is installed or not on your machine. Open a terminal shell and input:

.. code:: bash

  which conda

This command will display the path where conda is intalled. If conda is not found, install it using Mambaforge3:

- Linux Users:

.. code:: bash

  curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
  bash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/mambaforge3

- Macintosh Users with Intel processors:

.. code:: bash

  curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
  bash Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p ~/mambaforge3

- Macintosh Users with Apple Silicon processors:

.. code:: bash

  curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh
  bash Mambaforge-MacOSX-arm64.sh -b -p ~/mambaforge3

With Mambaforge installed in your home directory, export PATH so that it may be used:

.. code:: bash

  export PATH=$HOME/mambaforge3/bin:$PATH

Now that we can execute mamba, initialize it and then exit the terminal:

.. code:: bash

  mamba init
  exit

and then restart a terminal and check conda is installed to use or not:

.. code:: bash

  which conda

Install Fenics
---------------------------------

Create a virtual environment for FENICS and activate it:

.. code:: bash

  conda create --name fenics -q -y
  conda activate fenics

List all of the versions of fenics available on your platform with conda:

.. code:: bash

  conda search fenics --channel conda-forge

Install FENICS. In 2018, work started on FEniCSx: the new version of the FEniCS library. However, our FP solver is developed based on old version of FEniCS, whose installation should follow the below command:

.. code:: bash

 conda install -c conda-forge fenics mshr=2019.1.0=py38h255090a_2 fenics-dijitso fenics-dolfin fenics-ffc fenics-fiat fenics-libdolfin fenics-ufl

Install other dependencies
---------------------------------

Activate fencis virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

  conda activate fenics

Check ffmpeg (for post-processing) is installed:

.. code:: bash

  which ffmpeg

If ffmpeg is not installed, install it:

.. code:: bash

  conda install ffmpeg


Install the other python modules:

.. code:: bash

  pip install matplotlib scipy IPython

Using Fenics
---------------------------------

Each time we use fenics, activation of the fenics virtual environment is needed:

.. code:: bash
  
  conda activate fenics


Uninstall the fenics environment
---------------------------------

.. code:: bash
  
  conda deactivate   # if 'fenics' was currently activated
  conda remove --name fenics --all
